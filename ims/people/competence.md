# Competence Policy
This policy is a guide to how Made Tech assess the competence of its employees, both during the probation period and beyond.

## The Policy

All team members are assessed for competency by their Line Manager during their probationary period and regularly throughout thier time at Made Tech.

Every staff member has a personal role expectations. Progress with these expectations is discussed regularly with their line manager, as well as suggestions on how to improve and career progression goals.

### Learn Tech

We ensure everyone is fully trained to complete their role to the highest level. Moreover we ensure that all team members have an opportunity to engage in further learning and improvement in the core competences required for their role.

A cornerstone of our values is continuous learning and improvement, so we dedicate 10% of company time to personal development on Friday afternoons. This takes the form of ‘Learn Tech’: a session where all team members undertake training in a diverse range of topics including (but not limited to) new technologies and principles, business skills, and workshops.
