# Remote Working

This is the Made Tech policy on remote working. This is a guide to all forms of remote working, and applies to all Made Tech employees and contractors. It covers the ettiquette and best practices around remote working, as well as an emphasis on secure remote working practices that align with our ISO 27001 implementation. 

## The Policy

We feel it's important that we provide the flexibility for people to work wherever they feel productive and happy. Be that in the office, remotely at home, or from a coffee shop. We acknowledge that working remotely can lead to increased productivity, and have positive effects on wellbeing.

There are tradeoffs when choosing between working from the office and from home. Below is some general ettiquette for occasional remote work, along with guidelines for working remotely on a regular basis.

### Occasional Remote Working
- Check and clear any remote work with the rest of your team before the end of the previous working day
- Ensure your absence does not negatively impact the productivity and/or success of other team members
- Once agreed with your team and customers add time off as 'Working from home' in Charlie HR 
- Check that you're not needed on-site by a customer or your team
- Ensure you're available for your team ceremonies as normal, and are able to dial in without interruption
- Be a good Slack citizen and check in regularly and visbily with your team throughout the working day in public channels
- Ensure you're clear on your workload for the day or days you wish to work from home and ensure that you won't benefit from working closely with others
- Ensure you're not scheduled for any meetings or sessions
- Barring any extraordinary circumstances, we like people to be in the office on Friday for [lunch](/benefits/friday_lunch.md) and Learn Tech

### Regular Remote Working

There are some additional considerations when working from home regularly

- Talk to your team (and customers if necessary) ahead of committing yourself to working remotely on a regular basis
- Once agreed, put a recurring event in Charlie HR
- We recommend remote working on a recurring basis a maximum of 2 days per week when part of a delivery team to ensure you don't lose context.
- Make sure you choose days that will have the least impact on customers. A larger organisation's time will be less flexible and you'll need to ensure there are clearly set expectations around when showcases will be etc.

### Secure Remote Working

When remote working, and when onsite with a client, it is important to pay close attention to these security guidelines in addition to your normal security practices:

- If you are in a public place, such as a coffee shop, make sure you are handling any sensitive data responsibly and securely. Can you be overseen? Is your connection secure? 
 - Ensure any work-related conversations can’t be overheard. If that’s not possible, try to talk in general terms, and without specific details such as names or clients.
- You should continue to abide by the guidelines set out in our [Information Handling Policy](company/information_handling.md) and our [Clear Desk/Clear Screen Policy](company/clear_desk_clear_screen.md) when working remotely.
