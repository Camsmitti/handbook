# Security Training & Development Policy
This policy sets out the Made Tech guidelines around security training and development for team members. This policy applies to all team members, both employees and contractors, in both technical and non-technical roles.

## Policy
All Made Tech team members are briefed on the IMS policies and objectives when they join. Thereafter, regular training is provided. 

The training sessions include:
 - Why security awareness is required by all team members
 - Visitors and physical security
 - Security Incidents/Events and how to report them
 - Information Control Policy
 - Good Password Practice
 - Internet and Email Usage
 - Viruses
 - Clear Desk/Clear Screen 
 - General data protection regulation	
 - Social engineering and other techniques used to obtain sensitive information
 
We take a register of all attendees at the training session, as well as recording the session to make it more accessible for remote workers and anyone who may be absent on the day. We record the date a team member attended training in Charlie HR.
