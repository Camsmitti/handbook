# Physical Security

Keeping physical surroundings secure is an important part of a security policy. The Physical Security Policy ensures we maintain the security of our buildings, team members, and vistiors. All employees, visitors and contractors must comply with the policy.

## The Made Tech Head Office:
- The Made Tech Head Office is in a multi-tenanted building located at 4 Oâ€™Meara Street, London SE1 1TE. 
- No environmental risks (such as flooding) have been observed. 
- The landlord monitors the fire alarm and tests it weekly. 
- There are no environmental hazards or other health and safety risks in the office. 
- The office is designed and managed to ensure a comfortable working environment for staff.
- Keypads control access to the communal stairway and the Made Tech office.
  - A list of office of office Key Holders is maintained by the People Team
  - For the Made Tech office entrances, a code or fob may be used to gain access.
- There is a clear desk / clear screen policy in place.

## Visitors To The Office
- All visitors are signed in to the office, and assigned a member of the Made Tech team as their host. 
- Visitors must be escorted by their host when in and around the workstations and any sensitive information
- Visitors may be unescorted when in the general meeting rooms and communal areas.
- We store records of visitors on SaaS so it can be accessed remotely if needed. 

### Unauthorised Access
Attackers may attempt to gain access to our offices in order to do Made Tech or our clients harm. They may use techniques to gain your trust, take advantage of inattention, or capitalise on your desire to be helpful to gain access.

**Remain vigilant for:**
- Anyone you do not recognise trying to gain access to (or already in) the Made Tech office
- Individuals trying to follow you into the communal stairway or office
- Individuals trying to observe the access codes for the communal stairway or Made Tech office
- Anyone who cannot provide a credible reason for gaining access to the building or office
- Anyone who cannot name the member of the Made Tech team they are visiting
- Individuals trying to pressure you for information about our building or office

**It is always ok to:**
- Be sceptical of unusual requests
- Challenge (politely) any request for access from an unknown individual
- Verify the identity of a requester before signing them in
- When in doubt, refuse access and find the IMS manager or a member of the leadership team.
