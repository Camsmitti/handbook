# Clear Desk/Clear Screen Policy

Made Tech operates a Clear Desk/Clear Screen Policy. This ensures that all sensitive/confidential materials are removed from a user workspace and secured when no one is at the workspace.

A Clear Desk/Clear Screen policy is part of standard basic privacy controls, and encourages secure working practices amongst our team, both in our offices and whilst working remotely. It also helps us remain ISO 27001 compliant.

## The Policy:

### Clear Desk:
- All ‘Confidential’ information must be hidden from view when not being actively used.
- Hard copies should be kept in locked drawers or returned to the appropriate place in the office. 
- Drawers/files containing sensitive information must be kept closed and locked when not being accessed. The keys to these drawers/files should be kept in a secure location and not left unattended at any time.
- Printouts should be immediately removed from the printer.
- When no longer needed, restricted and/or sensitive documents should be shredded in the office shredder prior to disposal
- Passwords to confidential material should not be left on paper or sticky notes posted on or under a computer, or left unattended on a desk. For more information on handling passwords, please see our [Password and 2FA policy](link)

### Clear Screen:
- Electronic copies of confidential materials should always be stored in the appropriate Made Tech tool (Google Team Drive, GitHub etc.).
- If you need to leave your workstation for any reason, you should ensure your screen is locked and not visible to anyone.
- If you are using multiple screens, ensure you remain aware of what is displayed on both screens.
- When working outside the Made Tech Office (either from home, onsite with a client, or in a public space) ensure you remain aware of your surroundings and who may be able to view your screen. 

### Devices:
- When not in use, turning off your device to ensure disk encryption is enabled is important. This could include when inside a backpack or carrying case when travelling, as those can be lost or stolen
- USB drives or other mass storage devices should be secured a locked drawer when not in use. Personal data (as defined in the Data Protection Act 2018) must not be stored on such mass storage devices.

### Other:
- Confidential and restricted information should not be displayed on any whiteboards
