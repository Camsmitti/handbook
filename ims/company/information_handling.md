# Information Handling Policy

There are many types of confidential and sensitive information passing through Made Tech at any given moment. It is important that we as a company ensure that we are handling this information responsibly and in a secure way. If sensitive information is communicated to an unauthorised, and potentially malicious, party - there could be severe consequences. 

An Information Handling policy encourages seucre working practices amongst our team, both in our offices and whilst working remotely. It also helps us remain ISO 27001 compliant.

## General Guidelines:

All sensitive information (anything other than Public) is subject to the following information handling and disposal procedures:
- Passwords which provide access to sensitive information must not be given to any unauthorised person See our [Password and 2FA policy](password_and_2fa.md) for more details 
- Device screens should be locked with a password when not in use and not left unattended for any reason. See our [Clear Desk/Clear Screen Policy](clear_desk_clear_screen.md) for more details.
- Devices used to handle Made Tech or client related information should not be misused or placed at risk of theft, damage or misuse. See our [Device Security Policy](device_security.md) for more information.
- Users shall not try to disable or alter the antivirus software settings on their device

## When not at the Made Tech offices
When not at Made Tech offices you should ensure and hard copies of Made Tech information are
 - Supervised during printing and removed from the printer immediately when complete.
 - Not left unattended on a desk at any time.
 - Stored in a secured cupboard / drawer when not in use.
 - Mass storage devices (such as USB drives etc.) containing internal information should not be left unattended and should be stored securely.
 - When Internal information is no longer required (either in hard or electronic copy) it is destroyed and/or deleted appropriately
 - Information should not be stored locally, but on the backed up to an appropraite Made Tech tool. For more information, see below.

## Store data in Made Tech tools
Made Tech data should be stored in Made Tech tools. Check what your team is using.

Sensitive data (personal information for example user research, or commercial information for example contracts) can be stored on the Google Team Drive for your team, unless the data subject or owner has requested that the data does not go ‘off-shore’ (where data is processed or stored outside of the UK) for example, to the US.

Regardless of where it’s stored, you should ensure data is appropriately secured and backed up. Made Tech’s G Suite is backed up by automatically, but data on your Made Tech laptop is not.

If you can’t work on a Made Tech tool, make a local copy instead. Make sure you update the Made Tech tool version when possible, and then delete your local copy in a way that the files can’t be recovered.

Information should always be stored on the Made Tech provided services such as GitHub and G Suite. Information should never be downloaded onto a laptop unless there is a specific business need for the information to be available remotely and there is no suitable network connection available. When this is the case the information should be uploaded back to the server as soon as is practicable and the information on the laptop securely erased.

## What happens if an unauthorised party gains access to Made Tech information?

Any event which involves an unauthorised party gaining of access to any Made Tech information (other than information classified as Public) will be handled in accordance with our event logging procedure. 

This includes, but is not limited to:
 - Loss, theft, or unauthorised release of information in electronic or hard copy form, or equipment upon which the data is stored.
- Virus infection.
- Evidence of unauthorised access or use of your laptop, PC or passwords.

## Social Engineering

Leaving sensitive and confidential information in easy to access places is not the only way attackers can gain unauthorised access. Social engineering also makes us vulnerable. Attackers will use techniques to gain your trust, take advantage of inattention, or capitalise on your desire to be helpful to obtain information.

### Remain vigilant for anyone asking you to:
- Provide sensitive information about any aspect of our business, (contact numbers, username / password combos)
- Perform an action that is unusual or costly, (close down a customer system ‘immediately’)
- Download and opening a file you weren’t expecting
- Click on a link in an email or message that you don’t recognize, e.g. an invoice from iTunes or any other familiar supplier)
- Do something that ‘just doesn’t feel right’, particularly if you’re put under a lot of pressure.

### It is always ok to:
- Be sceptical of unusual requests
- Challenge (politely) any request from an unexpected or unfamiliar source
- Verify the identity of a requester before sharing information
- When in doubt, do not respond!

### Finally:
It's always better to be safe than sorry. Always check with the IMS Manager or CSO if you think something is amiss.
