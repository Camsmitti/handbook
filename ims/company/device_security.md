# Device Security

This is general advice on device security. For the purposes of this section, "device" not only applies to the laptop Made Tech will issue you with when you join the company, but also any personal devices you use to access Made Tech systems. This includes, but is not limited to, phones, tablets, etc. 

Please consult our BYOD policy and our Acceptable Use Policy for more information. 

## Laptop Setup

All Made Tech devices are set up with separate admin and user profiles, unless otherwise agreed with the relevant IMS governance team or leadership.

### General setup

- Register the make, model and serial numbers information on Charlie HR
- Your password/passphrase must conform to the Made Tech Password Policy which will be linked below.
- You must use 2FA wherever required by Made Tech. You should also use 2FA wherever possible.
- Store any 2FA backup codes as encrypted notes in your password manager or another secure location you will be able to access easily.
- You must keep your software up to date. Old versions of software are often vulnerable to attack. Update all the software on your device whenever a new version is available. You must update your software within 14 days of a new verison being released. This includes:
   - Your deviceâ€™s operating system
   - Web browsers
   - Extensions
   - Plug-ins

### Desktop

- [Encrypt your hard drive](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204837)
- Mac users must add [a firmware password](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204455)
- Non Mac users must add a BIOS password
- [Disable automatic login for OSX](https://www.intego.com/mac-security-blog/mac-security-tip-disable-automatic-login/)
- [Install iCloud/Find My Mac](https://www.icloud.com)
- Mac users must install remote MDM (Mobile Device Management) software 
- Antivirus must be installed on all devices (this is automatically done for Mac users via remote MDM software).

## Mobile

We all use personal mobile devices, so your options are either not to add any company accounts to your phone (this includes Slack, Gmail etc), or to follow the checklist below.

- [Create a 6 digit passcode (or better)](http://www.cnet.com/uk/how-to/secure-your-ios-device-with-a-six-digit-passcode-on-ios-9/)
- [Turn on auto lock](http://www.imore.com/how-change-auto-lock-time-your-iphone-or-ipad)

## How you connect your device to networks
We have our own VPN which automatically authenticates with G Suite. Everyone can use the service for a more secure experience (i.e. protecting yourself when using a public WiFi). To connect to the VPN, please refer to the [guide found in the Handbook.](https://github.com/madetech/handbook/tree/master/guides/vpn)

## Reporting an issue
You must tell Made Tech if your device that is used in connection with your Made Tech work is lost, stolen or otherwise compromised as soon as possible. You should report anything suspicious to the CSO or IMS Manager as soon as possible.

If you suspect that your device may be compromised (has a virus etc), you should telephone them rather than email them. Your emails could transfer malware from your device to other people or into Made Tech systems and services.
