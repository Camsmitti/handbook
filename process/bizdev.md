# Business Development

If you're wearing the Business Development mantle, you should check the following resources for opportunities every week and report back during The Board showcase.

## Recently funded startups

* [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/funding-rounds)
* [DNGeek](http://dngeek.com/category/newly-funded/)

Look particularly for UK-based companies who have just received Seed funding. If there's anything interesting, find a way to get in direct contact with the founders.


## Government

* [Digital Marketplace](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/digital-outcomes-and-specialists/opportunities)

Check the working locations of the opportunities to ensure they're not being delivered exclusively from client-sites way out of town. Be aware that opportunities posted will almost certainly be subject to tender.
