# Business Development

If you're holding the Business Development mantle, you should check the following resources for opportunities every week and report back during The Board showcase.

## Recently funded startups

* [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/funding-rounds)
* [DNGeek](http://dngeek.com/category/newly-funded/)

Look particularly for UK-based companies who have just received Seed funding. If there's anything interesting, find a way to get in direct contact with the founders.


## Government

* [Digital Marketplace](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/digital-outcomes-and-specialists/opportunities)

Check the working locations of the opportunities to ensure they're not being delivered exclusively from client-sites way out of town. Be aware that opportunities posted will almost certainly be subject to tender.


## Segmenting leads

When a lead gets in touch with us via the website, calling in, or email, we add them to our master contact list.

You should use tools such as LinkedIn to find out what you can, and based on what they contacted us about, use this to populate their profile in Campaign Monitor, particularly:

- Source
- Interests
- Persona
- Lifecycle stage
- Sector
