# Made Manifesto

At Made Tech, we're tying to build an open and transparent company, full of people who love their work and enjoy the challenges they face every day. To do this, we want everyone to understand what is expected of them, the things we value and the things we try toÂ avoid.

We believe people do their best work and are most fulfilled when they are learning new skills. Our ambition is that **everyone** in the company improves **every single day** and that we create a new model for software services, which other companies will try to replicate in years to come.

This manifesto should become the starting point for any new starters. It's the place the team should go if they are unsure of how we approach things like expenses, referral bonuses etc. This document was borne out of Continuous Feedback that team members were unclear on some of our company policies. 

We're a company that moves fast, so we're going to need everyone to help us keep this up to date. If you encounter something that you think should be in this Manifesto, add it to the document. If you see something that doesn't represent our current thinking, gather feedback and update it.
