#Introduction to OKRs at Made

####How to write an OKR
OKR stands for Objectives & Key Results.

OKRs are purposefully difficult to write. A well written OKR represents clear thinking and focus on achievable goals. Badly written OKRs represent muddled thinking and will be difficult for your colleagues to understand. Take the time to draft and edit a well written OKR.

####Time Period

All OKRs are dated and scoped to a specific time period. At Made we scope all OKRs to 3 months.

####Objectives

Objectives are personal goals you have to move our business forward. In writing an objective you are saying to the team "I will lead Made to achieve this Objective". As a rule of thumb, you should generally have three Objectives per quarter.

Bad objectives are often:

* Unspecific ("Write better code and have more test coverage")
* Boring ("Upgrade my laptop")
* Overly specific ("Create screenshots of finery website for Made website case study")
* Lack compelling business value ("Change our DVCS provider")

Good objectives:

* Tell us why we care ("Launch a Spree Commerce area within the Made website")
* Are memorable and sticky ("Work myself out of the day-to-day running of Byron & Kjus projects")
* Are written so that any reader can instantly understand and visualize the business value ("Improve conversion rate on SV")
* Are exciting! ("Launch Finery!")

If you are having trouble writing an objective, imagine you are standing up in front of the team completing this sentence "Over the next 3 months I will lead the effort at Made to XXXXX".


###Key Results

Key Results are measurable milestones that track progress towards your objective.

Bad key results are often:

* Squishy – not totally clear if they happened or didn't happen ("built some features")
* Describe milestones in the abstract rather than specific deliverables ("Work with team to conceive some product ideas")
* Describe milestones of too small or too large a scope ("Do post-mortems")

Good key results:

* Binary – they were either clearly achieved or they were clearly not achieved ("Signed software services agreement with Brooks")
* Are well defined concrete deliverables that prove results ("Share logins for our product with the team")
* Objectively measurable metrics ("Reduce build time on Finery project by 50%")

If you are having trouble writing a key result, imagine you are sitting in a room with the team reviewing your OKR after the period ends. Now imagine you were asked to bring in physical proof of your key results towards your objective.

What would be all the physical proof points you could bring to prove measurable progress toward your objective? These could be metrics you hit on a dashboard, documents you created you could print, emails from customers using our product etc. Each proof point is a key result. Key results are work products you have to prove you made progress towards the objective.

If you ever have trouble writing a Key Result, answer this question "I would prove we hit this key result by showing XXXXXXX".
