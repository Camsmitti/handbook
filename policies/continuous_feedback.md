#Continuous Feedback

The techniques we use to deliver software tell us to value things like regular, open communication and fast feedback loops. We’re aiming to cultivate a culture where individual performance can be evaluated and coached equally regularly.

There is a growing trend for organisations to throw away the annual / bi-annual review, and move to more informal and more frequent check-ins. Adobe is one such business, and they’ve published much of their collateral online, on which this structure is based.

In contrast to how feedback is delivered at present, which is a largely ‘top-down’ approach, we would like to shift to a model where each team member is ultimately responsible for pro-actively soliciting feedback on their own performance.

##Frequency
One of the primary objectives is to give timely feedback, so ‘as often as necessary’ would be the canned answer. As a minimum guide, everyone should have a check-in at least every 2 weeks.

##Roles
| Team        | Mentor            | Director  |
| ------------- | :-------------- | :------ |
| Ensure you are receiving feedback by soliciting feedback and scheduling check-ins with mentors <br /><br />Look for opportunities to share specific examples of feedback with team members| Deliver ongoing timely, positive, and constructive feedback<br /><br />Collect feedback from stakeholders that can be used to assess overall performance| Ensure ongoing feedback is occurring<br /><br />Hold mentor accountable for giving ongoing feedback |

Everybody in the business falls under the team role. Mentor roles are expected to be more fluid, depending particularly on the project focus at the given time. Initially this role will be provided by a combination of Rory, Chris, and those fulfilling project lead roles.


##How to Give and Receive Feedback


###Giving feedback
The SAID model provides a simple way to give effective, positive, and constructive feedback:

* **Specifics:** state what has or has not been done using concrete examples
* **Ask:** ask open ended questions to understand their perspective (How do you see the situation? Did I contribute to the problem in some way?)
* **Impact:** express the impact on the team or the business. When framed as a means to reach a specific business objective, it should become an opportunity to solve a problem or understand the impact of the actions
* **Do:** state what needs to continue or change

###Receiving feedback

* Listen carefully
* Ask questions - seek to understand the impact
* Ask for specific examples if you are not clear
* Remember that we all have areas for development
* Don’t become defensive (feedback is hard to give, and we want to encourage everyone to be giving more feedback)
* Say “thank you”
* If you choose to implement the feedback, check back in future to validate improvement


##Discussion Guide

###Expectations
---
Some sample questions you and your mentor can discuss to have a great check-in:

* Over the next period of time (sprint, week, month), what are the critical priorities that we must accomplish? How do they align with team / organisation goals?
* What is the overall desired outcome? What will success look like? How will we measure it?
* What is important context (constraints, history, third parties) that would be useful to know in order to achieve the desired outcome?
* When and how shall we check-in to review progress?
* How can the mentor support you in achieving the expectations? 

###Feedback
---
Feedback should be given with the following principles in mind:

* Given with positive intent to help to be more effective in future
* Close to the event
* Don’t give feedback when angry or upset
* Leverage the SAID model
* Two questions to give effective feedback:
    * What does this person do well that makes them effective? Be specific and share with them why it’s impactful
    * What is one thing, looking forward, they could change or do more of that would make them more effective?

###Growth & Development
******
When driving discussions and planning your development, here are some things to consider:

* What skills and strengths do I have that I want to continue to leverage or build on?
* What skills and knowledge do I need to develop to perform well in my role?
* What are business needs I see that can provide an opportunity to help me grow in these areas?
* What are my long term aspirations?
* What support do I need from others to be more successful?
* How will I measure my success?
