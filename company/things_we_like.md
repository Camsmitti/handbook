#Things we like to see

* Aim to commit frequently (many times per day)
* Always commit into master, as we favour continuous integration over feature branches. 
* Always include descriptive commit messages (ideally referencing Jira tickets)
* Try not to break the build. Make sure you run the test suit before pushing to origin/master.
* Don't mark tasks as 'done' until they are production ready. 
 * have been cross browser tested
 * checked against designs
 * code refactored
 * optimised and should have a unit / feature test (when necessary) etc. 
 * Are considered 'Done done' http://www.jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/done_done.html
* The earlier you tackle the difficult sprint tasks, the better.
* Daily stand-ups are at 9:30am, join via Skype or email a standup before
* If you're emailing a standup, be descriptive e.g. Styling of cart line items and flash notification for mobile and desktop breakpoints' is better than 'working on the cart' 
* Loudly flag any blockers to Nick and chase until they are removed.
* Make sure you communicate with the team frequently. Ask questions / for clarifications if you're unsure. 
* Ask somebody for help if you've run into a problem and can't solve it within ~1hr (it's likely somebody else has encountered it)
* Client showcases are key, so try to be in the office for these
