## Beliefs & Values

###Beliefs
* We believe that everyone in our company should be learning something new every day. We invest heavily in initiatives which will help us cultivate an environment where **everyone** is striving to perform better.

* We believe that responsibility is taken, not given. We believe people need to to use their own initiative and take opportunities when they present themselves.

* We believe that 'doing' is more valuable than 'talking'. We don't have account managers or talkers amongst our ranks and everyone we hire is a doer.

* We believe that nearly all organisations can move faster than they do. We try to help them to do this.

* We believe the adoption of Agile is in its infancy and that Agile principles (and various spin offs) will underpin all high-performance businesses in years to come.

###Values

- **People:** We value and respect the people we work with, both within the company and without, and want them to feel able to express their opinions safely and without fear.

- **Space:** We value the space in which we work, and want it to be a place in which everyone can pursue and share knowledge whilst feeling respected, comfortable and productive.

- **Culture:** We value a positive and diverse company culture, and will always strive to adapt our culture in order to make this a more welcoming place to be.
