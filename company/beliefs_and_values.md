## Beliefs & Values

###Beliefs
* We believe that everyone in our company should be learning something new every day. We invest heavily into initiatives which will help us to cultivate an environment where **everyone** is striving to perform better.

* We believe that responsibility is taken, not given. We believe people need to to use their own initiative and take opportunities when they present themselves.
