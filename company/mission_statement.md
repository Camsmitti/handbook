# Our mission

> Our mission is to improve software delivery in every organisation.

We've seen many organisations constrained by poor choices when it comes to software. Whether it's keeping a slow legacy system around, or neglecting a team that needs help, these decisions impede an organisation's ability to compete in a competitive world.

We believe there's a better way, one that encourages an open and collaborative relationship with everyone involved, and one that places importance on the ability to deliver great software quickly.
