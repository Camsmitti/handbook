# Roles at Made Tech

Roles are a way for us to describe a Made Tech employee's primary purpose and
function. It's essentially a job title but really we use it to denote the need
for the role and the expectations of staff that fill the role. We also use them
to indicate next steps for staff who have mastered their current role and are
looking for more responsibilities.

Complementary to our roles we define traits. Traits are additional needs and
expectations that can be taken up by anyone at any time. Of course one should
already be achieving their needs and expectations for a role before taking on
traits and be achieving current traits before taking on more.

## Defining roles

### Defining a need for a role

In order to justify paying a wage for a role and in order to interview
candidates for a role we first need to define a commercial need. The need will
specify high level functions for that role, e.g. "to work directly with customers",
or "to report on all marketing activity that we invest in".

Once we have defined a role's need we can then begin to hire with that
specification in mind. If we didn't have a role defined we may well end up
hiring someone without a clear picture of what job the candidate will perform
which can confuse both them and us as a business.

### Defining expectations for a role

After defining a need for a role we then define expectations. Expectations are
measurable goals with a time range, e.g. "to be fully billable after 2 weeks
on-boarding", or "to be selling proactive improvement services to customers
within 6 months".

Defining expectations is a useful practice so that potential recruits know what
will be expected of them when they join. It is a minimum bar that must be met
for us to justify having someone in the role.

### Beyond a role

So the need outlines why we are hiring, and the expectations define the bar for
the role, but what about going above and beyond? We would love everyone in the
company to go above and beyond these expectations! In fact we pretty much expect
everyone in the company to be meeting them and then asking us what more they can
do to help the company.

When we see people pushing the limits of their current role, and when we see
people already fulfilling other roles we will jump on this as soon as we notice
to offer up extra activities or even a new role.

We want to foster a culture where everybody feels empowered to do their role and
as they feel comfortable and ready push in any direction they wish.
