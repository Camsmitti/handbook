# Untracked Holiday

We're building a high-performance organisation that delivers great software products. We recognise that this requires a lot of hard work and that for our team to perform at their highest possible level, they need to live a well-balanced life and take regular time-out for rest, relaxation and rejuvenation.

We have adopted an untracked holiday policy, where each team member is given the flexibility to take whatever holiday they need. We believe this policy will help us to perform at the highest possible level. 

## Who approves holiday?

We want to ensure teams own their holidays and that includes thinking about the commercial impact of taking them. To that affect we need to make sure you've done the following before booking holiday:

* Ask your team mates if it's okay with them
* Ask your customers if it's okay with them
* Ensure your responsibilities are covered whilst you're away
* Ensure that the holiday is placed in the [holiday calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/madebymade.co.uk_83gtf1a3s2ecshli2o6ub4kpmk%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)

## How long are you taking?

We trust you'll use your best judgement when taking holidays but in case you want some guidance on the kind of notice we expect when you take your holiday:

* **Less than 1 week:**<br>We recommend giving at least 2 weeks notice for a 1 day off and closer to 4 weeks notice for more
* **Between 1 and 2 weeks:**<br>We recommend giving at least 4 weeks notice for this kind of holiday, ideally more.
* **Greater than 3 weeks:**<br>Please try and provide at least three months notice, so we can prepare for your absence.

## Additional considerations

* We use the calendar when working out project allocation and the number of days being billed to customers, so it's important that it is always up-to-date and accurate.

* Employees will not “accrue” holiday days under this policy, therefore you will not receive compensation for “unused” holiday time when you leave.  

* Time off due to illness and/or injury are handled separately. Unlimited holiday cannot be used for these types of absences.

* If a team members performance declines significantly due to abuse of this policy, then we reserve the right to review their use of this policy.

* Having several team members away at the same time can make life really difficult for everyone else. Try to forward-plan your holiday, so it doesn't have a detrimental affect on your team mates or on the company.
