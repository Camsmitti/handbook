# Tech-scheme

We are signed up to Techscheme, part of Cyclescheme, which you can upon successful completion of your probation.

Techscheme lets you get the latest tech worth up to £2,000. You then spread the cost with payments from your salary across 12 or 24 months and make a National Insurance saving of up to 12% too. 
Best of all – you own the products from the beginning and there’s no end of hire fee.

You can calculate your savings by using their [calculator](https://www.techscheme.co.uk/how-it-works)

# Process for buying tech products

- Pick your tech products from [Apple](https://www.apple.com) or [Curry's] (https://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/index.html)
- Work out how much you want to spend - up to £2,000
- Visit: https://www.techscheme.co.uk/eb76a9
- Fill out the request form - you will need your payroll number 
- Once your certificate has been requested let a director know so they can find the email and approve it
- Techscheme.co.uk will then generate and send an invoice to one of the directors (this will take some time, potentially a few days)
- Once the invoice has been paid, download your certificate/provide it to the chosen retailer
- Enjoy your Tech products!
