# Remote Working

We feel it's important that we provide the flexibility for people to work wherever they feel they're going to be most productive and happiest. Be that in the office, remotely at home or from a coffee shop. 

Do you find you're most productive WFH during early mornings? Why not start at 6am and finish at 2pm? Do you need to be somewhere at 4pm on a Tuesday? Re-jig your day so you can do this. 

All we ask, is that you:

* Check and clear it with the rest of your team before the end of the previous working day.

* Ensure you're available for a daily standup with your team.

* Ensure you're completely clear on your specific workload, down to the task level, for the following day, and that you're certain you won't benefit from working closely with others on this. 

* Ensure you're not scheduled for any meetings or other sessions.

* If you have been working from a customers office, check they don't need you on-site. 

Barring any extraordinary circumstances, we like people to be in the office on Friday for [lunch (and hopefully beers)](/benefits/friday_lunch_beers.md).
