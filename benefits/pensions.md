# Pensions

We provide a pension plan which everyone is automatically enrolled on.

You will be enrolled as soon as you pass your probation period which will be stated your employment contract.

## Contributions

As your employer we will contribute towards your pension alongside your own contribution. The Government is currently rolling out a workplace pension scheme which we are following. This will see both employer and employee contributions scale up over the next 3 years, subject to parliamentary approval and guidelines.
