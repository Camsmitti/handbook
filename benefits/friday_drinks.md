# Friday Drinks

Every Friday we supply post-work drinks at the office. This weekly ritual provides an opportunity for the team to socialise.

As drinking is exclusionary in nature to those who don't like or can't be around alcohol we make efforts to make sure it's not the center of our culture whilst at the same time acknowledging it's important to some.

Few rules:

* Where possible, encourage customers to join us for drinks. 

* We encourage you to invite friends of Made Tech and people we might consider hiring to Friday drinks. It's a good opportunity to meet both socially. 

* Although we provide drinks in the office, please be respectful of others and the office space.
