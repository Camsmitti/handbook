# Unlimited Holiday

At Made Tech we're building a high-performance organisation that continuously delivers great software products. We recognise that this requires a lot of hard work and that for our team to perform at their highest possible level, they need to live a well-balanced life and take regular time-out for rest, relaxation and rejuvenation.

We have adopted an unlimited holiday policy, where each team member is given the flexibility to take whatever holiday they need. We believe this policy will help us all to perform at the highest possible level. All we ask is that you follow a few guidelines:

* We use a shared Google Calendar to track who's away on holiday. Once booked, please check that your holiday is recorded in here. This calendar is used when working out project allocation and the number of days being billed to customers, so it's important that it is always up-to-date and accurate.

* To book holiday, just send an email to the most appropriate person and include the dates of that you require.

* If you're only taking a few days off, this can be approved by one of your sprint or support team mates.

* If you're taking more than one week off, this should be approved by Rory or Chris at least one month in advance. 

* Having several team members away at the same time can make life really difficult for everyone else. Try to forward-plan your holiday, so it doesn't have a detrimental affect on your team mates or on the company.

* If you're taking three (or more) weeks off, please try and provide at least three months notice, so we can prepare for your absence. 

* Employees will not “accrue” holiday days under this policy, therefore you will not receive compensation for “unused” holiday time when you leave.  

* Time off due to illness and/or injury are handled separately. Unlimited holiday cannot be used for these types of absences.

* If a team members performance declines significantly due to abuse of this policy, then we reserve the right to review their use of this policy.
