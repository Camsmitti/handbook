# Company Credit Cards

We don't want to approve every company purchase. We would rather trust people to make reasonable spending decisions than assume people will abuse the privilege by default.

We offer all our full time staff a company credit card, which can be used for discretionary spending. If you want a book, some software or you just want to go to a conference, it is on us. We just ask you to be reasonable with your spending.

Here's some examples of things people have purchased:

* Programming books
* Computer equipment i.e new monitor
* Amenities for the office, such as coffee, fruit, biscuits etc
* Lunch and beers for a customer
* Taxi back to the office after a meeting
* Taxi home after working late
* Stationary i.e post-it notes, notepads etc
* Conference tickets 

If you would like a card, [download this form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7Zb_9JeCVRkRUlFQWdEVmpEWlE/view?usp=sharing), fill in the first page and email a copy to [Rory](mailto:rory@madetech.com).
