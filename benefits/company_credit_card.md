# Company Cards

We don't believe in filing expense claims in triplicate, or that every single company purchase needs to be pre-approved by Chris or Rory. 

We offer everyone a company credit card, that can be used for discretionary spending. If you want a book, some software or you just want to go to a conference, it is on us. We just ask you to be reasonable with your spending.

If there is a problem, we will let you know. We would rather trust people to make reasonable spending decisions than assume people will abuse the privilege by default.

Here's some examples of things people have purchased on their cards:

* Some programming books
* New monitor and computer equipment
* Some amenities for the office, such as coffee, biscuits etc.
* Lunch and beers for a customer that we've been working with.
* Taxi back to the office after a meeting.
* Taxi home after working really late.
* Post-it notes, notepads etc.

If you've not got a card and would like one, [download this form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7Zb_9JeCVRkRUlFQWdEVmpEWlE/view?usp=sharing) and fill in the first page and email a copy to Rory.
