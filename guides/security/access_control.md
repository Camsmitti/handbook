# Access Control

## Team-level access control

Made Tech access controls reflect that:
- We trust our team members to act responsibly, and to abide by the Acceptable Use Policy
- We trust our team members to access appropriate sites when using the internet

It is the responsibility of teams (delivery teams and business teams) to ensure that team members have the appropriate access to the information and services they need to perform their role.

On delivery teams it is the Delivery Lead who should ensure that team members can access the information and services required to work on a client delivery. The Delivery Lead should also ensure that this access is revoked when a team member leaves the team, or a delivery shuts down.

For business teams, it is the responsibility of the head of department to ensure that all team members have the appropriate level of access to tools and services. e.g. for the People Team, it is the responsibility of the Head of People. For the Operations Team it is the COO. 

## Made Tech-wide access control
For business-wide services and tools, an Access Control Register (ACR) is maintained by the Security Manager. It is currently in the form of a spreadsheet. This register details what team members are allowed access to and at what level.

This register is updated each time a team member joins or leaves Made Tech, or there is a relevant change in role within the company. When a team member leaves Made Tech, their record is moved to the â€˜Previous Employees', reflecting their access level at the time of leaving for the purposes of audit.
