# Data Protection

Made Tech complies with regulations under the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Data Protection Act 2018. It is the company’s policy to protect and hold safe all Personal Information which it requires or needs to possess in the performance and management of its operation.

Below are guides for team members on the course of action to take if they receive a request regarding personal data.

## Data Access Requests and Data Deletion Requests

Under GDPR, an individual has the right to be informed whether or not their personal data is being processed and, if so, to be informed of the following:
 - What personal data is being processed 
 - The purposes for which the personal data is being processed
 - Who, if anyone, the personal data is disclosed to
 - The extent to which the personal data is being used to make automated decisions relating to the individual
 
Individuals also have a right to request personal data deletion. Both data access requests and data deletion requests can be made by individuals verbally (e.g. over the telephone), as well as in an email or postal letter.

For any request relating to data access or data deletion, we must comply with the following:
 - Acknowledge the data subject’s request.
 - Ask for two proofs of identity to ensure the individual is the data subject 
 - Request information on the types of data in question (e.g. type and timeframe of data in question) and the relationship of the individual with Made Tech (e.g. customer or supplier).
 - Inform the COO of the request with the above information immediately. 
 - The COO will process the request accordingly and respond to the data subject in line with the legislation. They may ask for input and/or provision of data from other teams to comply with the request. 

## Requests to be forgotten
In cases of requests to be forgotten, we must comply with the following process:
 - Acknowledge the data subject’s request.
 - Ask for two proofs of identification to ensure the individual is the data subject.
 - Request information on the types of data in question and the relationship of the individual with Made Tech (e.g. customer or supplier).
 - Inform the individual that a record of their basic information (e.g. name and company) may be kept with a note to not contact again. **If the individual requests this information also be deleted then they must be informed that contact may be made in the future.**
 - Inform the COO of the request with the above information immediately.
 - The COO will process the request accordingly and respond to the data subject in line with the legislation. They may ask for input and/or provision of data from other teams.
