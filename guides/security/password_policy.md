## Password Policy
The purpose of this policy is to give guidance for the creation of strong and secure passwords following the [NIST security guidelines](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#memsecret)

### Password creation

- [ ] Use a secure password generator to generate complex passwords
- [ ] Password length should be a minimum of 8 characters
- [ ] Length is crucial because it increases entropy (number of uncertainty)
- [ ] Never write down or share your passwords
- [ ] Do not use a password for more than one account (reused passwords should be flagged by LastPass)
- [ ] Password manager should follow this password policy
