# Password and 2FA policy
Strong password and appropriate use of 2FA (two factor authentication) are important aspects of device and software security. We all have passwords for multiple systems that are used for business related purposes and it is the important for all team members to take the appropriate steps to secure their passwords. 

## Password Creation
- Passwords must be sufficiently strong such as to make cracking or guessing difficult
- Where possible, passwords should be randomly generated (you can do this in your password manager)
- Passwords should be more than 12 characters and contain a mixture of upper case, lower case, numbers and special characters
- Do not use the same password for access to Made Tech systems as for any personal accounts. If you do this, and your Made Tech password is compromised, it will open your personal accounts up to vulnerablities and vice versa.

## Password Management
We use password management for Made Tech services. Individual vaults are managed by the teams who use them, and the password manager is managed by the Operations Team.

Your password to access your password manager should confirm to the password policy. Biometrics is also an acceptable method of accessing the password manager.

## Password Security

### Obtaining Passwords via Social Engineering

Cracking passwords or a brute force attack are not the only ways in which individuals with bad intentions can get into the Made Tech systems. Social engineering also makes us vulnerable. Attackers will use techniques to gain your trust, or take advantage of inattention or a desire to be helpful to obtain passwords. Keep in mind the following:

- Made Tech passwords are shared on a need-to-know basis. All passwords are to be treated as sensitive, internal information belonging to Made Tech
- Only share Made Tech passwords with persons / systems authorised by the system owner, and only share by secure means
- Passwords must not be revealed over the phone
- Do not write passwords down and store them anywhere in the office. 
- Do not store passwords in a file on a computer system or mobile device (phone, tablet) without encryption.
- Do not reveal a password on forms
- Do not hint at the format of a password ("my hometown/first pet's name/etc was...")
- Be sceptical of unusual requests
- Be aware of potential phishing attacks
- Consider who may be shoulder surfing
- Hover your mouse over links in e-mail to ensure the web address makes sense
- Verify the identity of a requester before sharing information
- When in doubt, do not respond!

It's always better to be safe than sorry, so report anything you think is amiss!

### 2FA
Wherever possible, Made Tech uses 2FA as a means of adding an extra layer of security. Please ensure you are enabling 2FA wherever possible.
