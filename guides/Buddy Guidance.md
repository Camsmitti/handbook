# Buddy Guidance

A buddy is a friend at Made Tech. In normal times, they would show you all the good food places near the office, and take you out for a coffee or lunch. In current times it might be a Hangouts coffee chat.
Buddies proactively and frequently check in with a new starter to see how they are doing and if they need any help.
Kind of like your designated person to direct questions to, outside of the People Team.
